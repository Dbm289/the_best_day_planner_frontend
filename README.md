I want to thank my cohort lead, Ronnie Boniface, for her invaluable help in shaping my project and for her in-depth walkthroughs and videos. Cernan Bernardo's walkthrough videos were also extremely helpful in structuring my project and getting it up on its feet. My girlfriend, Eleanor, helped me a lot as well and I could not have finished this project without her looking it over and telling me I was not making any sense.
